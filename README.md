# Udemy_100daysPython_Day11
This is a repository I use for code from [Udemy's 100 days Python - Day 11](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/learn/lecture/19658862#content)

This is a Capstone project from what we have learned from the previous days.
In the project I will build a Blackjack game, once the requirements are given, I will build it myself and review the teacher's solution to give notes and learn other methods.
